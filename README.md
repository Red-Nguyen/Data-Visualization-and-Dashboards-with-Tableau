Option 2: Causes of Death

## Project/Goals
The primary objective of this project is to explore and analyze the dataset containing various causes of death across different countries over several years. I aim to understand patterns, trends, and correlations in the data, focusing on identifying the top countries with the highest number of deaths and clustering countries based on multiple causes of death. I'm particularly interested in understanding how patterns of multiple causes of death co-evolve over the years across various countries.

## Process
### Step 1: Data Preparation
I started by loading the dataset into Tableau, which contains detailed information on different causes of death, death numbers, entities (countries), codes, and years. I thoroughly examined and cleaned the data, ensuring its readiness for analysis.

### Step 2: Data Exploration
Implemented filters and sorting features to focus on specific causes of death and time frames. Visualizations were created to have an initial understanding of the distribution and trends of deaths related to distinct causes across various countries.

### Step 3: Top N Countries Analysis
I filtered the data to visualize the top N countries with the highest death numbers. Various parameters and calculated fields were introduced to make the filter dynamic, allowing for easy adjustments to the number of top countries displayed.
### Step 4: Clustering Analysis
Use clustering to group countries based on the evolution of various causes of death over the years. Each cluster represents countries with similar trends and patterns in causes of death, providing insights into common health issues and challenges faced by countries within that cluster. I also grouped them by disease name and number of deaths during the year.

### Step 5: Visualization Enhancement
I enhanced the visualizations by adding labels, tooltips, and employing various color schemes to increase data interpretability and viewer engagement. The incorporation of sets and other elements facilitated a more detailed and comprehensive analysis. Utilizing Tableau's dashboard features, I integrated diverse visualizations to provide a holistic and interactive view of the data insights, ensuring an intuitive user experience and facilitating in-depth data exploration.

## Results

For Option 2, I chose a dataset containing detailed records of death causes, numbers, and geographic locations over the years. 
My questions: 
	1. How does the prevalence of each disease vary across each selected country, and what patterns or correlations can be observed in the data?
	2. Top n countries with the highest number of deaths.
	3. Examine the yearly trends in deaths for each disease and specifically focus on the top n deadliest diseases. Identify any notable patterns or anomalies, and analyze the influence of these top diseases on the overall mortality rate.
	4. Visualize the specific causes of death and the corresponding total number of deaths for each cause in a selected year, and forecast the expected number of deaths for these causes in the upcoming five years.
	5.  Identify the outlier diseases. Is there any correlation between these outliers and specific geographic areas? Determine which countries are most impacted by these diseases, measured as a percentage.

I created a series of visualizations to answer this question, including bar charts showing the top N countries with the highest deaths and cluster analyses visualizing the grouping of countries based on similar death cause patterns. These visualizations helped identify trends, correlations, and patterns in the data, offering valuable insights for targeted health interventions.

## Challenges 
The main challenge was dealing with a large and detailed dataset, requiring careful cleaning and filtering to extract meaningful insights. 
Limited resources, including time can hinder the comprehensive analysis and implementation of findings.

## Future Goals
If given more time, I would explore more advanced analytical techniques to uncover deeper insights into the data. I aim to conduct a more granular analysis of specific causes of death, analyze seasonal and temporal trends, and study the impact of various factors such as policies, healthcare quality, and environmental conditions on the causes of death patterns across countries. I would also look into predictive analytics to forecast future trends and identify potential areas for health interventions.
